- This blog is currently under TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION!
- I will reupload my visualisation/data science projects back after code cleanups are done.
- Nowadays I am under overwhelming courseworks but (hopefullyðŸ¥²) circumstances will get better soon...

I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University, studying **Earth Environmental Sciences, Computer Science and Engineering, and Business Administration**. (Yes! Triple major!) Until last spring, I was deeply engaged in mesoscale atmospheric modeling, but ironically while conducting the research.. I got obsessed with **DATA VISUALISATIONðŸ“Š**! (To be honest, actually I've been in love with graphs and charts as far as I can remember hahaðŸ˜Š) As a result, currently I am participating in [HCI+D LAB](http://hcid.snu.ac.kr) as a undergraduate researcher and my primary research interests are **data visualisation** and **CSCW(Computer-Supported Cooperative Work)**.
