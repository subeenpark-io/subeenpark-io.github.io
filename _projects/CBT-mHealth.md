# Collaborative CBT App for Anxiety Problems
## Motivation

How do you treat your anxiety? Life is overwhelming from time to time, and it is never easy to deal with those panic attacks in a non-toxic way. It is undeniable that life has its ups and downs, however, we still have a chance to cope with our downs in an adequate method. Do some meditations, clarify your feelings and their reasons, and plan how you will keep your face and let things just slide over next time when you face it. Above all, do all these things **TOGETHER**!

## Project Description

##### What is CBT?

CBT(Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of mental problems including depression and anxiety disorders. Numerous research results suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications. Thus, **we planned to bring this precious concept, CBT, into mobile applications, so that as many people as possible can have access to the treatment.**   *[Cite](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral)*

##### What's Different from Other CBT Apps?

Novelty of our research, **COLLABORATIVE LEARNING OF CBT SKILLS**, comes from the concept of **DBT(Dialectical Behavioural Therapy)**. DBT, a type of CBT, includes **group skills training** as part of its curriculum. Practicing psychological skills in a group has a positive effect on coping with mental problems since it provides the opportunity of polishing maladapted behaviours and chance for practicing the treatment in advance of the actual situation. In addition, it also improves personal engagement and self-awareness of group members. These positive aspects of group skills training have been proved by research among several domains such as borderline personality problems, and we are planning to expand the domain to anxiety problems.
